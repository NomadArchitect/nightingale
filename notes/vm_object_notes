vm_object is a {ptr, len}

physical? virtual?

processes can share vm objects

    process A -> its ELF
    process A -> some dll A
    process B -> that same dll A / same phy

    the dll needs to be the same phy memory
    not _necessarily_ the same virt memory
    
also

    we're interested in tracking allocated memory.
    we have say the multiboot map
    I should be able to ask if it's already mapped
        (**all of it**)
    I should be able to unmap it *and reuse the memory later*
        virt and phy - phy at least
        that's a question though, this is <1 page
        what else is on that page? anything?
        how do we know?
        account for everything!
        including the kernel!
        we know start/end of kernel ro and kernel rw
        and early pts.


so that said

    How do we store these things?
    anything intelligent?
    a list?
    how many will we need?
    disperate lists? early one? malloc others?
    tree?
