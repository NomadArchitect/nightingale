Long Term:
- Redo VFS
  - Redo procfs
- Add net back
- Lock important resources [resilience]
- Dynamic linking [linker]
- Track memory pages & regions vmm + pmm

Random things:
- handle_syscall should probably be in syscall.c

Known bugs:
- pages are never freed. See: active/vmm .


VFS notes:
- vfs's do lookup themselves
- store list of all mountpoints, longest match
- i.e.:
  - '/' -> tarfs
  - '/proc' -> procfs

  - "/proc/foo" goes to procfs as "/foo"

  Files are not stored in memory as a tree, the vfs handles all of that
  nonsense, getting files from the disk / backing store / information site
  when needed.

  Yeah, sure, this means tarfs will scan all of the files it knows about when
  you ask for a directory listing, but __that's okay__

  Similarly, directory listing /proc will go to a function that knows how
  to find all active processes & threads, not a in-memory tree of procfiles.

  `struct file`s will only be created on-demand.
