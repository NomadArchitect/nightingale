REWORKING THREAD STATE MACHINE:

Threads should have multiple state machine variables

One holds lifecycle

 preinit -> started -> active -> killed -> dead
                          \               /
                           ---------------

The other holds active state

 running <-> blocked
             wait
             iowait
             trwait
             sleep
