Fix -O2 (again)

Long Term:
- Redo VFS (again probably)
  - Redo procfs
- Add net back
- How does ipc work
- Lock important resources [resilience]
- Dynamic linking [linker]

Random things:
- handle_syscall should probably be in syscall.c
- sys_traceback should return traceback, not print it from kernel mode
