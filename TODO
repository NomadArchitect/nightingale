Fix -O2 (again)

Long Term:
- Redo VFS (again probably)
  - Redo procfs
- Add net back
- How does ipc work
- Lock important resources [resilience]
- Dynamic linking [linker]

Random things:
- handle_syscall should probably be in syscall.c
- sys_traceback should return traceback, not print it from kernel mode
- shell operator precedence is backwards - they should all be left associative
  not right. I probably need to juggle back and forth between parse_paren
  and a parse_operator or something.
- symbol lookup in kernel modules

Bugs:
- clone fails one some calls but not others
- socket refcounts are off - can be freed while in directory
- remove sys_top in favor of /proc/threads
- uthread crashes
- open("") crashes
